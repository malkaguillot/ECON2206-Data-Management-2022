## Course project
I would like you to chose a standard [research or policy or business] question that you can answer using data (eg. where are located the death from covid? Where are the cheapest beers in Liège? At what time people go to work? When and where should you go sailing?)

You will develop a project abiding by the good practices taught in class. The project should incorporate:

- Include an original **data collection step** (webscraping)
- The **main output** should be a `dash page` that you develop on `Herokuapp`, and should include;
  - Some text, with brief explanations regarding : the question asked, the choice and the nature of the data (you do not have to include the data steps [collection & cleaning] here), the exhibits (should have reading notes) and what you conclude from them.
  - 4 exhibits: 2 tables and 2 Figures (using different commands)
  - The possibility to modify the visualization using button for at least one exhibit

**Submission format**: Invite @malkaguillot and @michel to collaborate on your GitHub repository by the due date.

    - This means, we expect well version controlled work.
    - a github folder with at least 5 commits (bonus if you have several development branches!)
    - Tag your final submission using the following `git command git tag -a 1.0 -m "submitted version"`.
    - You must have a `README.md` in the main directory with:
      - instructions on how we can build the assignment & what it does;
      - a link to the deploymed application.

Projects should be realized by group of 1 or 2 (one group of 3 if there is an odd number of remaining students).

**Project milestones**
We will discuss about your proposed project several times so that we can evaluate whether it is do-able within the time frame. The project will be organized around the following milestones, materialized by a presentation in class:
- ML1: Project idea & scraping methodology (5 minutes)
- ML2: Visualization plan (5 minutes)
- ML3: Final presentation (5 minutes)
At ML3, you should also hand the final course product (by inviting us to your gitlab folder).

## Problem sets
The Problem sets are simple exercises designed to help you to “get their hands in the data”. They will be available on Lola and should be handed in there. These problem sets will take the form of Jupyter notebooks, that will have to be converted in pdf before being handed in.
